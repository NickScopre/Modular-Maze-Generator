# Modular Maze Generator

## Installation
### If you are already familiar with Python:
Just download the source and set up a virtual environment using `requirements.txt`.

### If you are not:
1. [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Make sure to select the "Add to PATH" option during installation.

2. Download the Repository from the [Releases](https://github.com/Bytestorm5/GalaxyGen/releases/tag/Release) page.

3. Unzip the file into whatever folder you like

4. Open the Command Prompt (or if on Mac/Linux, the equivalent terminal) and [Navigate](https://www.digitalcitizen.life/command-prompt-how-use-basic-commands/#ftoc-heading-3) to the same folder you extracted the repository into.
This should be the same folder that contains `editor_site.py` as well as the rest of the scripts.

5. Create a Virtual Environment
Use `python -m venv ./venv` to create a Virtual Environment for the program to run in. You can technically skip this if you really wanted to,  but a virtual environment is best practice.

6. Enter the Virtual Environment
Use `venv\Scripts\activate` to activate and enter the Virtual Environment. This is the only step you will have to repeat after initial setup.

7. Install Dependencies
Use `pip install -r requirements.txt` to download the required packages for MMG. 

If you've closed the terminal window and need to return to GalaxyGen, you simply need to navigate back to the same directory and run `venv\Scripts\activate`. (Equivalent to steps 4 and 6) This will put you back into GalaxyGen's environment and allow you to run its scripts.
